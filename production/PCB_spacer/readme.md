## PCB
Gerber and drill files -> [spacerPcb.zip](https://github.com/weteor/Tipper-TF/blob/main/production/PCB_spacer/spacerPcb.zip)

#### Production Parameters:

- Layers: 2
- PCB Thickness: depends, recommended are at least **0.8mm** and **1.0mm**
- Dimensions: 48 mm* 14 mm
- Designs: 1

## remarks
spacer pcbs can be stacked do get the desired height of the pinky column. I prefer 1.8mm, so i use 0.8 and 1.0mm spacer pcbs. 

Heights up to 2mm can be realized with just pcb spacers. The switches can still be soldered directly on the backside of the main pcb. If a higher level is
needed, you have to use 1.27mm pitched pin headers under the spacer pcb.
